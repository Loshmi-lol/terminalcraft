My project is a simple task manager. I created it for my small buisness as I have no previous experience in Excel and I find it hard to keep track of everything in it. So I made my own!

The program has a few features, like: 
-Calculator
-To-Do list
-Inventory manager

When you run the program 4 options will pop up. By entering a number you chose the task that you want the program to run.
Also program saves all data that you edntered in it.

Example if you inputed a few To-Do tasks like:
-order cheeseburgers
-drink water

the program will automatically save them.
Also if you delete the tasks they will stay deleted when you re run the program.

Also you can keep track of your inventory. You can add a item name, amout of items that you have and a description of the item.

Happy compiling!
